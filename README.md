# Image Thresholing
 
Thresholding is the simplest method of image segmentation. From a grayscale image, thresholding can be used to create binary images. Thresholding methods are categorized into many groups based on the information the algorithm manipulates, in our project, we focus on different clustering-based Thresholding methods. We analyze various image pre-processing methods, categorize them, express their formulas and show a comparative study of all these methods.

As a part of preprocessing thresholding with segmentation is used for The description of the Otsu thresholding method along with histogram (based on intensity) and the result is documented. And according to our survey Otsu thresholding is better. Image thresholding is used in many applications as a pre-processing step. For example, you may use it in medical image processing to reveal a tumour in a mammogram or localize a natural disaster in satellite images.

A problem with simple thresholding is that you have to manually specify the threshold value. We can manually check how good a threshold is by trying different values but it is tedious and it may break down in the real world.

To solve this problem, we are devising a method which can predict the perfect threshold for an image that can be useful for its real-life application. The Methods we have studied include all types of thresholding techniques such as Adaptive thresholding, Simple thresholding, Otsu's thresholding method, and Kapurâ€™s thresholding method.
